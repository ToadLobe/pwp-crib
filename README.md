I am creating an interactive web app using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. The purpose of the app is to act as an interactive crib sheet for a PWP (mental health assessor) for use during a psychological assessment. I have attached two files for additional context: one is the official annotated mark scheme for a PWP assessment, and the other is an html version of a Notion file that has been serving as my current crib sheet. This crib sheet has been working okay for me, but I feel an interactive web app would drastically speed up the assessment by funnelling my attention to the correct and relevant questions/information based on previously gathered information. Much of the difficulty in conducting a PWP assessment comes from the fact that I am searching up and down my crib sheet for specific information, having to expand toggles to find relevant wording, and scanning diagnosis tables to make on-the-fly decisions that align with treatment frameworks.
